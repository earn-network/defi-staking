# Staking implementation
The quick way to equip your project with a staking solution.

### 1. üìà Planning Your Staking Solution 
To begin, carefully consider the network on which you want to deploy your staking pools. Earn Network currently supports pools on a per-asset basis, allowing you to focus on one network for each asset. Additionally, you have the option to launch either Locked or Flexible staking pools, or even both.
