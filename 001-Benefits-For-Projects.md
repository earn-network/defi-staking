# Benefits For Projects

The core benefits that come to crypto projects by listing their tokens on the  DeFi Staking solution.

**Tailored Staking Mechanisms**

Earn Network's DeFi Staking offers coin developers the choice between two staking options: Locked and Flexible. With these options, projects have the freedom to set various parameters such as staking duration, penalties, maximum and whitelisted participants and more. This flexibility allows projects to tailor their staking mechanisms to best suit their specific requirements.

**Cost Savings**

By implementing DeFi Staking, coin developers can save significant costs on developing and auditing their own smart contracts. The Earn Network provides a secure and tested staking infrastructure, eliminating the need for developers to invest time and resources in building their own from scratch. This cost-effective solution allows projects to allocate their budgets to other important areas of development.

**Enhanced User Interface**

The Earn Network's DeFi Staking platform offers a ready-to-use and well-designed user interface. This intuitive interface not only simplifies the staking process for users but also enhances the overall user experience. A user-friendly interface boosts delegation amounts and increases conversion rates, resulting in higher engagement and participation from the staking community.

**Technical Support and Custom Improvements**

Coin developers partnering with the Earn Network receive full technical support and assistance throughout the integration process. The Earn Network team is committed to helping developers optimize their staking solutions and address any technical challenges that may arise. Additionally, developers have the opportunity to request custom improvements and tailor the platform to their specific needs.

**Expanded Audience Reach**

By integrating with Earn Network's DeFi Staking, coin developers gain exposure and access to a huge niche audience. Through the Earn Network and its partner platforms, developers can connect with a community of enthusiastic stakers who are actively seeking new opportunities for yield generation. This expanded audience provides projects with increased visibility, liquidity and potential for growth.

**Coming Soon: Robust SDK with Easy Implementation**

The Earn Network is continuously evolving to meet the needs of coin developers. In the near future, a robust Software Development Kit (SDK) will be introduced, featuring libraries that allow developers to easily implement the Earn Network interface into their own websites or applications. This upcoming SDK will streamline the integration process and provide developers with a seamless interface for their users.

By leveraging the benefits of Earn Network's DeFi Staking, coin developers can unlock new opportunities for their projects, enhance user engagement and tap into a broader audience of stakers.
